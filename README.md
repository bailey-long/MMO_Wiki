# MMO_Wiki
<a href="https://living-lore.web.app/">MMO_Wiki</a>
A wiki page for a hypothetical MMO game.

I intend on completely designing the alpha version of an MMO game using this website to experiment with using wikis as a form of documentation

## Notes for myself

### Links
Firebase handles href links differently, instead of pointing from where the file is, it instead points directly from the directory, meaning every link to index.html will be the same no matter which
directory it is in.

### Commands

firebase emulators:start
Runs live server to test changes on, gives port to open in browser through console.

firebase deploy
deploys site on firebase hosting
