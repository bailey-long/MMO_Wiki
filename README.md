# MMO_Wiki
<a href="https://living-lore.web.app/">MMO_Wiki</a>
A wiki page for a hypothetical MMO game.

I intend on completely designing the alpha version of an MMO game using this website to experiment with using wikis as a form of documentation. Anyone wanting to contribute to the wiki with things they would like to see in a game of this type can feel free! this is a wiki after all.

## If you want to help:
I am looking for artists, writers and game designers at this point in time.
Artists: skill icons.
Writers: quests, characters, locations, lore etc.
Game designers: game design stuff idk.

## Notes for myself

### Links
Firebase handles href links differently, instead of pointing from where the file is, it instead points directly from the directory, meaning every link to index.html will be the same no matter which
directory it is in.

### Commands

#### firebase emulators:start
Runs live server to test changes on, gives port to open in browser through console.

#### firebase deploy
deploys site on firebase hosting
