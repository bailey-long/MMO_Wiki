    <p>
        The player starts from nothing in a large sandbox open world called The Lattice. They will have to fight monsters, craft weapons, trade with npc's and other players to obtain 
        the gear that they require to survive in the world. The game will not have a major plot to it but rather small to large subplots that they can explore through various quests. 
    
        The players can build houses, set up stores, host events and in general do mostly whatever they want to. If players want they can capture monsters and pit other players against them in combat for a reward.
